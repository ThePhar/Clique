This is where the sounds would go.

Since I don't own them, I don't include them with this project, but you can always include your own.

Folder should have:
-----------------------------
click.wav - The button click.
cheer.wav - The victory cheer.
error.wav - Clicking the button when locked.
unlock.wav - The unlock sound of the button.
